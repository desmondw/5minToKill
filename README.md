5 Minutes to Kill (Yourself)
=============
Last edit before repo: 8/4/2008

AdultSwim used to promote their web games platform by displaying the top 10 for the leaderboard for the most recent games on TV. One such game was 5 Minutes to Kill Yourself. I researched (read: played) the game a lot before I realized in order to get to the top of the leaderboards I'd need a script. This is that script.

Screenshots
=============
Proof that the script worked. You can see here that I got 7th place for that week, dispite the rampant traffic manipulation that is endemic to flash games with leaderboards.
